Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, to create a responsive and visually appealing carousel. Here's a brief explanation:

1. **Bootstrap Framework**: You've chosen Bootstrap for its ease of use and extensive library of pre-built components. Bootstrap's Carousel component provides a simple way to implement a carousel with minimal custom code, making development faster and more efficient.

2. **HTML Structure**: You've structured the HTML markup according to Bootstrap's Carousel documentation. This includes elements such as `carousel-indicators`, `carousel-inner`, and `carousel-item` to define the structure of the carousel and its contents.

3. **Bootstrap CSS**: By including Bootstrap's CSS file (`bootstrap.min.css`), you leverage Bootstrap's built-in styling and responsive grid system. This ensures that the carousel and its components are visually appealing and adapt well to different screen sizes and devices.

4. **JavaScript**: Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle (`bootstrap.bundle.min.js`) is included to provide the necessary functionality for the carousel, such as sliding between images and handling navigation controls (`carousel-control-prev` and `carousel-control-next` buttons).

5. **Customization**: You've added custom classes (`bg-success`, `p-2`, `text-dark`, `text-center`, `text-white`) to style the background color, padding, and text color of the page. These customizations allow you to tailor the appearance of the carousel and the overall layout of the page to your preferences.

In summary, your approach combines the power of Bootstrap's Carousel component with minimal customizations to create a fully functional carousel that is responsive, visually appealing, and easy to implement.
