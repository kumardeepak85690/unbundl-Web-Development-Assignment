The approach taken here involves using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple and lightweight solution for building a custom chocolate bundle. Let's break down the key aspects:

1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML file provides the structure for the webpage, including placeholders for the chocolate options, selected items, and total price. This structure is straightforward and intuitive for users to understand.

2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS file styles the elements of the webpage to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. It includes basic styling for layout, typography, and spacing to enhance readability and usability.

3. **JavaScript Interactivity**: JavaScript is used to dynamically generate checkboxes for each chocolate option based on the data provided. Event listeners are added to these checkboxes to update the selected items and total price whenever the user makes a selection or deselects an item.

4. **Data Handling**: The chocolate options are stored as an array of objects in the JavaScript code. This approach allows for easy modification and expansion of the available chocolate choices. Additionally, a selected count variable is used to enforce the constraint that the sum of chocolates should not exceed 8 items.

5. **No External Frameworks or Libraries**: In this implementation, I've opted to use pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without relying on external frameworks or libraries. This choice keeps the solution lightweight and reduces dependencies, making it easier to maintain and deploy.

Overall, this approach prioritizes simplicity, performance, and flexibility, making it suitable for a small-scale project like a custom chocolate bundle builder. If the project were to scale or require more complex features, incorporating frameworks like React or Vue.js and backend technologies like Node.js or Firebase could be considered. However, for the current requirements, the chosen approach provides a practical and efficient solution.
